    <h2>BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE</h2>

    <p><i>Fugitive Pieces</i>, Byron's first volume of verse, was
    privately printed in the autumn of 1806, when Byron was
    eighteen years of age. Passages in Byron's correspondence
    indicate that as early as August of that year some of the poems
    were in the printers' hands and that during the latter part of
    August and during September the printing was suspended in order
    that Byron might give his poems an "entire new form." The new
    form consisted, in part, in an enlargement; for he wrote to
    Elizabeth Pigot about September that he had nearly doubled his
    poems "partly by the discovery of some I conceived to be lost,
    and partly by some new productions." According to Moore,
    <i>Fugitive Pieces</i> was ready for distribution in November.
    The last poem in the volume bears the date of November 16,
    1806.</p>

    <p>A difficulty in supposing the date of completion of the
    volume to be about November 16 is that two copies contain
    inscriptions in Byron's hand with earlier dates. On the copy of
    the late Mr. J.A. Spoor, of Chicago, the inscription reads:
    "October 21st Tuesday 1806&mdash;Haec poemata ex dono
    sunt&mdash;Georgii Gordon Byron, Vale." That on the copy in the
    Morgan library reads: "Nov. 8, 1806, H.P.E.D.S.G.G.B.,
    Southwell.&mdash;Vale!&mdash;Byron," the initials evidently
    standing for the Latin words of the preceding inscription. The
    Latin "Vale" in each inscription, however, suggests that it
    commemorates a leave-taking, the date referring not to the
    presentation but to the farewell.</p>

    <p>It has been suggested that copies of the volume were
    distributed earlier than November and that some of the poems,
    printed separately and distributed in fly-leaf form, were added
    later. This would explain such discrepancies as the early dates
    of the inscriptions, and the presence of Byron's name on pages
    46 and 48 in a volume otherwise anonymous, but there is little
    evidence to support it.</p>

    <p>Moore's account of <i>Fugitive Pieces</i> is that it was
    distributed in November, Byron presenting the first copy to the
    Reverend J.T. Becher, prebendary of Southwell minster, who
    objected to what he considered the too voluptuous coloring of
    the poem "To Mary." The objection led Byron to suppress the
    edition immediately, he himself burning nearly every copy. This
    account is corroborated in part by Miss Pigot and in part by
    Byron.</p>

    <p>Immediately after the destruction, Byron began the
    preparation of a second volume, to replace <i>Fugitive
    Pieces</i>. This appeared in January, 1807, as <i>Poems on
    Various Occasions</i>, Byron describing it as "vastly correct
    and miraculously chaste." Of the 38 poems that constitute
    <i>Fugitive Pieces</i>, all except "To Mary," "To Caroline,"
    and the last six stanzas of "To Miss E.P." were reprinted in
    <i>Poems on Various Occasions</i>. Nineteen of the original 38
    poems occur in Byron's third work, <i>Hours of Idleness</i>,
    published in June or July, 1807. All three editions were
    printed by S. and J. Ridge, booksellers of Newark, England.</p>

    <p>Byron himself never reprinted the poems "To Mary" or "To
    Caroline," or the last six stanzas of "To Miss E.P." Except in
    a limited facsimile of <i>Fugitive Pieces</i>, supervised by H.
    Buxton Forman in 1886, "To Mary" has never been
    reprinted&mdash;not even in supposedly complete editions of
    Byron's works.</p>

    <p>Only four copies of <i>Fugitive Pieces</i> are known to-day,
    and one of these is incomplete. The copy from which the present
    facsimile is made was originally given by Byron to Becher and
    preserved by him in spite of his objections to the poem "To
    Mary." From Becher's family it passed into the possession of
    Mr. Faulkner, of Louth, solicitor for the Becher family. In
    1885 it was in the possession of H.W. Ball, antiquary and
    bookseller of Barton-on-Humber, who sold it to H. Buxton
    Forman. Forman used it for his facsimile, but incorporated
    certain manuscript corrections of the original, so that his
    facsimile is not exact. The original is now owned by Mr. Thomas
    J. Wise, who has kindly permitted its use for the present
    facsimile.</p>

    <p>Of the other three copies, the incomplete one, lacking pages
    17-20 ("To Mary") and all after page 58, is in the possession
    of the family of the late Mr. H.C. Roe, of Nottingham. This was
    originally sent by Byron to Pigot, then studying medicine in
    Edinburgh. Byron later asked Pigot to destroy the copy and
    Pigot seems to have complied so far as to tear out the
    offending verses "To Mary." For many years it was thought that
    only the Pigot and Becher copies had escaped destruction at
    Byron's hands. But another complete copy came to light in 1907
    and is now in the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York. This
    contains numerous manuscript corrections and alterations, and
    seems to have been used as a proof copy for <i>Poems on Various
    Occasions</i> (not, as has sometimes been stated, for <i>Hours
    of Idleness</i>). A fourth copy, also complete, was offered at
    public sale in 1912, and is now in the hands of the executors
    of the late Mr. J.A. Spoor, of Chicago.</p>

    <p>The present facsimile is an exact photographic reproduction
    of the text with all typographical and other errors as in the
    original, except that certain manuscript corrections which
    appear in the original perforce appear in the photographic
    reproduction, as follows:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>1.) On p. 5, in the first line of the footnote, the
        Morgan copy reads "piece" where the Wise copy reads
        "p&#729;ece," the "&#305;" lacking.</p>

        <p>2.) The two pages of signature M are incorrectly
        numbered in the Wise copy as "41, 41," this copy having no
        page numbered 42; and are incorrectly numbered in the
        Morgan copy as "40, 42," the latter copy having no page
        numbered 41. The text of these pages is identical.</p>

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
